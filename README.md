Blocky
======

Simple project for trying out some ideas in Metal.

One of the side goals of this is to try and combine Metal with functional programming in Swift.  I'm starting with
a pretty standard object oriented approach, then using that to build up a set of pure functions that make coding
in Metal easier, including doing the kinds of things you would expect in a game environment.  My goal is to end up
with a library of functions that can be used to quickly build up a new app, using new classes in that app to hold
whatever state is needed and implement anything that is usually more object oriented, like the View Controller's and
general UI.
